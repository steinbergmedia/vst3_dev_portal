  - New IMidiLearn (plug-in): allow a plug-in to get the currently live playing MIDI CC to implement custom MIDI learning.
  - New IPlugInterfaceSupport (host): allow a plug-in to ask the host if a given plug-in interface is supported/used by the host.
  - New IVst3WrapperMPESupport (wrapper): allow a plug-in to set up MPE support in wrappers.
