---

**VST 3** Interfaces to be implemented by a **VST 3** host:

- [\[3.0.0\] Interfaces supported by the host](../Change+History/3.0.0/Host+Interfaces.md).
- If MIDI is supported: [\[3.6.12\] MIDI Learn](../Change+History/3.6.12/IMidiLearn.md).
- [\[3.6.12\] Host Query Interface support](../Change+History/3.6.12/IPlugInterfaceSupport.md).
- If a plug-in implements *IPluginViewContentScaleSupport*, the host should follow the [\[3.6.6\] PlugView Content Scaling](../Change+History/3.6.6/IPlugViewContentScaleSupport.md) requirements.
