## Introduction

Managing large plug-in sets and multiple virtual instruments on typical studio computer systems can often be difficult because of CPU performance limits. **VST 3** helps to improve overall performance by applying processing to plug-ins only when audio signals are present on their respective inputs. Instead of always processing input signals, **VST 3** plug-ins can apply their processing economically and only when it is needed.

The feature is supported by the [IAudioProcessor](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/classSteinberg_1_1Vst_1_1IAudioProcessor.html) interface of the plug-in.

The silence flags is part of the [AudioBusBuffers](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/structSteinberg_1_1Vst_1_1AudioBusBuffers.html) ([silenceFlags](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/structSteinberg_1_1Vst_1_1AudioBusBuffers.html#a2c73b926e22ddb05193b6edd16a008f8)) passed from the host to the plug-in and back to the host in the process call:

- MyPluginProcessor::process (ProcessData& data)
- for the inputs: check this flag: **data.inputs\[0\]silenceFlags**
- for the outputs: set this when the plug-in generates or notsilence: **data.outputs\[0\].silenceFlags**

The silence flags are a bitmask where each bit corresponds to one channel of a bus (for example L and R for stereo bus).

>â“˜ **Note**\
>The host has the responsibility to clear the input buffers (set to something near zero, like 10e-7, to prevent de-normalization issue) when it enables the silence flags (the output silence flags will be set by the host to no silence (=0)), on the other side the plug-in, if it produces silence output, has the responsibility to clear (set to zero) its output buffers and to correctly set the output silence flags.
