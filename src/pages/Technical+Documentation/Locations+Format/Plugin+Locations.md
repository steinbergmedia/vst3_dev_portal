## Introduction

A **VST 3** plug-in should be installed at specific folder location, the following tables specify these predefined locations for different operating system.

>ⓘ **Note**\
>**VST 3** doesn't require a plug-in registration like it is used with DirectX.

>⚠️ **Warning**\
>Links, Symbolic links or Shortcuts could be used from these predefined folders.

3 levels of folder location are defined:

- **User**: available only for the current logged user
- **Global**: available for all users of the system
- **Application**: available only inside a specific Audio Application (local plug-ins)

>ⓘ **Note**\
>The host should scan, at first, higher level of priority. First found plug-in (for a given Processor UID) has to be used.

### On macOS platform

On the macOS platform, the host application expects **VST 3** plug-ins to be located in:

| Prio  | Location      | Path                                          |
| :-    | :-            | :-                                            |
| 1     |  User         | /Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/ |
| 2     |  Global       | /Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/                 |
| 3     |  Global       | /Network/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/         |
| 4     |  Application  | $APPFOLDER/Contents/VST3/                     |

>ⓘ **Note**\
>The host recursively scans these folders at startup in this order (Global/Application).

### On Windows platform

On the Windows platform, the host application expects **VST 3** plug-ins to be located in:

| Prio  | Location      | Path                                          | Comment   |

| 1     | User          | %LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/Common/VST3/          | FOLDERID_UserProgramFilesCommon native bitdepth:<br> • 32bit Plug-in on 32bit OS,<br> • 64bit on 64bit OS<br> Mainly used for development use case. <br> example: C:\Users\MyUserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\VST3 |
| 2     | Global        | /Program Files/Common Files/VST3/             | FOLDERID_ProgramFilesCommon native bitdepth:<br> • 32bit Plug-in on 32bit OS,<br> • 64bit on 64bit OS |
| 2     | Global        | /Program Files (x86)/Common Files/VST3/       | 32bit Plug-ins on 64bit Windows |
| 3     | Application   | $APPFOLDER/VST3/                              | |

>ⓘ **Note**\
>The host recursively scans these folders at startup in this order (Global/Application).

### On Linux platform
