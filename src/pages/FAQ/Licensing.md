## Q: Do I have to sign and send to Steinberg the "Proprietary Steinberg VST 3" license agreement for each new version of the VST 3 SDK?

- No, the license agreement has its own versioning, you just have to be sure that you have already signed the correct version of it.
- As of SDK version **3.6.8**, the license has the version **2.0** (only some minor change/formatting of the text of the license agreement were done in the last SDK versions \[3.6.9 up to 3.7.1\])
  - **If** you use a **VST 3 SDK version >= 3.6.8**, you have to be sure that you sent Steinberg a signed license agreement (*version 2.x*) from one of the last **VST 3 SDK**s (>= 3.6.8).
  - **If** you use a **VST 3 SDK version < 3.6.8**, you have to be sure that you sent Steinberg a signed license agreement (**version 1**) included in the **VST 3 SDK** that you use.
  - **If** you do not know if you already sent it, it is recommended to send it again and in this case it is possible to use the license agreement of the **last VST 3 SDK**, too!
  - **If** you have signed a license agreement (**version 2.x**) and a new released **VST 3 SDK** uses a new license agreement (**version 3.x**), then you have to signed it again.
- The previous explanation also applies to used 3rd parties SDK like JUCE/iPlug/SynthEdit... just check which **VST 3 SDK** version is used by the 3rd party SDK you work with and sign the correct license agreement or the last available one.

## Q: I would like to share the source code of my VST 2 plug-in/host on GitHub or other web-based exchange platform.

- It is allowed but be sure that you do NOT include the Steinberg VST 2 files: like *aeffect.h* and *aeffectx.h*. These files are under a different license which does not allow redistribution!

## Q: I am a developer/company and I want to develop and distribute a VST 2 plug-in and/or host in binary form.

- If you have signed the VST 2 license agreement (before October 2018), you can.
- If not, you are not allowed to distribute it!
- See [here](../Main+benefits+of+VST+3/Index.html)!
