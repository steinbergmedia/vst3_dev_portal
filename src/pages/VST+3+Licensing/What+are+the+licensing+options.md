You can choose between the *"Proprietary Steinberg VST 3"* or the *"Open-source [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)"* license (**dual-license**) depending on how you want to distribute your VST 3 plug-in/host. **The License Agreement could be found here and in the VST SDK package**.

## "*Proprietary Steinberg VST 3*" license
The "***Proprietary Steinberg VST 3***" license allows you to distribute your VST 3 plug-in/host in a binary form. However, please note the following requirements:
- You need written permission from **Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH** in order to distribute your VST 3 plug-in/host (Steinberg will send you the countersigned License agreement included in the SDK that you signed and sent to us).
- You need to mention **Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH** in the about box and/or documentation of your VST 3 plug-in/host and follow the [Steinberg VST usage guidelines](../VST+3+Licensing/Usage+guidelines.md).

If you accept it, please enter all required information, sign it and send it back to us, either via land mail (to the [Steinberg address](https://o.steinberg.net/en/extras/about.html) mentioned in the license), or via e-mail (<reception@steinberg.de>) or via fax (+49 (0)40 210 35-300). We will countersign the license agreement and send it back to you.

## "Open-source [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)" license

The open-source license lets you share the source code of your VST 3 plug-in/host ***including the VST 3 SDK's sources which are subject to the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).***

>ⓘ **Note**<br>
