This developer use case guide will help you to decide which **VST 3** licensing model to choose. The **VST 3 SDK** has new Usage Guidelines to follow for all licensing models, please read them carefully!

# [Steinberg VST usage guidelines](Usage+guidelines.md)

Whenever **VST**Â® is used or the SDK has been used to create a product or the SDK is included (Open-source [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) case), it is required to add the reference to [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/) by using the **VST compatible logo** as supplied by [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/). Included in the VST SDK, the **VST compatible logo** can be found in the folder *VST_SDK/VST3_SDK/vst3_doc/artwork*.

# [What are the licensing options for VST 3?](What+are+the+licensing+options.md)

You can choose between the [Proprietary Steinberg VST 3](What+are+the+licensing+options.md#proprietary-steinberg-vst-3-license) or the [Open-source GPLv3](What+are+the+licensing+options.md#open-source-gplv3-license) license ([dual-license](What+are+the+licensing+options.md#steinberg-dual-license-file)) depending on how you want to distribute your VST 3 plug-in/host. **The License Agreement could be found here and in the VST SDK package**.

# [Which files fall under which license?](Which+files+fall+under+which+license.md)

All files describing the VST 3 interface, except VST 2 files, located in the folder *"pluginterfaces"* of the SDK, fall under the dual-license described previously.
