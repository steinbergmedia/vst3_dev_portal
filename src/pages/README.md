## Welcome to the world of VST 3

![VST Logo](../resources/VST_logo_white.png)

This part of the [Steinberg Developer Resource](https://developer.steinberg.help/display/SDH/Steinberg+Developer+Resource) is a portal dedicated to developers of **VST 3** plug-ins and **VST 3** hosts. Almost everything you need for developing **VST 3** plug-ins is explained in the sections below.

## [What is VST?](What+is+VST/Index.md)

Virtual Studio Technology (**VST**) is an audio plug-in software interface that facilitates the integration of software synthesizers and effects in digital audio workstations (DAW).

## [Main benefits of VST 3](Main+benefits+of+VST+3/Index.md)

Here, you can find a non-exhaustive list of **VST 3** benefits.

## [What is the VST 3 SDK?](What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Index.md)

The **VST 3 SDK** (Virtual Studio Technology Software Development Kit) is a collection of software development tools included in one package. This allows plug-in developers to create plug-ins in **VST 3** format and host developers to load **VST 3** plug-ins into a DAW or audio editor.

## [VST 3 licensing](VST+3+Licensing/Index.md)

## [Getting Started](Getting+Started/Index.md)

- [VST 3 Links](Getting+Started/Links.md) — Important links you will need for working with **VST 3**
- [How to setup up my system for VST 3](Getting+Started/How+to+setup+my+system.md) — In order to build **VST 3** plug-ins, you need the source code of the **VST 3** (API: interface definition), an IDE/compiler, cmake and a **VST 3** host application.
- [Preparation on Windows](Getting+Started/Preparation+on+Windows.md) — Generated **VST 3** Microsoft Visual Studio Projects using the [cmake](<https://cmake.org/>) files included in the SDK will create by default symbolic links for each built plug-in in the official **VST 3** folder, in order to allow this on Windows you have to adapt the Group Policy of Windows.
