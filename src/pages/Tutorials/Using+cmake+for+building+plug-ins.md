## Goal

This tutorial explains how to use *cmake* with **VST 3 SDK**.

---

## CMake for building VST 3 plug-ins

The SDK provides a set of cmake files allowing you to compile the included samples and to develop new plug-ins.

- Download cmake from: <https://cmake.org> or use a package manager for your OS (See [How to set up my system for VST 3](../Getting+Started/How+to+setup+my+system.md)).
- You can use the command line or the cmake editor ([cmake-gui](https://cmake.org/download/)).

## Command line for Windows

Example for building **Microsoft Studio 17 2022** solution:

``` c++
// go in to the folder where you extracted the VST 3 SDK
mkdir build
cd build
cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 "..\vst3sdk"
// or without symbolic links
cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 "..\vst3sdk" -DSMTG_CREATE_PLUGIN_LINK=0

// or with symbolic links but using the user location (enable by default), it does not request admin right
cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 "..\vst3sdk" -DSMTG_PLUGIN_TARGET_USER_PROGRAM_FILES_COMMON=1

// note: you can find the string definition for different Visual Studio Generators in the cmake online documentation
```

---

## Command line for macOS

 Example for building **Xcode** project:

``` c++
// go in to the folder where you extracted the VST 3 SDK
mkdir build
cd build
/Applications/CMake.app/Content/bin/cmake -G"Xcode" "../vst3sdk"
```

---

## On Linux with QtCreator

You can use **QtCreator** 2.3.1 (or higher)

- start QtCreator 2.3.2
- open the CMakeLists.txt located at the top of the **VST3_SDK** folder
- click on the menu Build->Run CMake

---

## Use of cmake-gui

- start the CMake (cmake-gui) application
- set **Where is the source code** to the location of the **VST3_SDK** folder
- set **Where to build the binaries** to a build folder of yourchoice
- click on **Configure**
- click on **Generate** for creating project/solution

Example of cmakegui application on Windows

- Compile with cmake command line

``` c++
cd build
cmake --build
```

- Choose a specific compiler with cmake (command line on Linux)

``` c++
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++

// or

cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++
```

## Using your IDE for compiling the examples

- Solution/project (vstsdk.sln/vstsdk.xcodeproj) is generated in the *"build"* folder.
- The created plug-ins are located in the *"build"* folder, in sub-folders ***/VST3/Release*** or ***/VST3/Debug***.
- In order to allow a DAW to find these plug-ins you have to create links from the official [VST 3 Locations](../Technical+Documentation/Locations+Format/Index.html) to them.
