## Goal

This tutorial explains how to set up your computer and create an environment for compiling the **VST 3** audio plug-in examples provided with the **VST 3 SDK**. These include plug-ins like simple DSP effects (Gain, compressor, delay, ...), synths instruments and some plug-ins showing how to handle some specific **VST 3** features (Note Expression, Program Change, channel info context, ...).

They can be loaded into **VST 3** hosts like Cubase, WaveLab, ...

---

## Part 1: Getting and installing the VST 3 SDK

For downloading the SDK, see this section "[How to set up my system for VST 3](../Getting+Started/How+to+setup+my+system.md)".

Download cmake from: <https://cmake.org/download/> or use a package manager for your OS.

---

## Part 2: Building the examples on Windows

- Create a folder for the build and move to this folder (using cd):

``` c++
mkdir build
cd build
```

- Generate the solution/projects: specify the path to the project where CMakeLists.txt is located:

``` c++
cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ../vst3sdk
or without symbolic links
cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ../vst3sdk-DSMTG_CREATE_PLUGIN_LINK=0
```

>â“˜ **Note**\
>You can find the string definition for different Visual Studio Generators in the cmake online documentation (<https://cmake.org/documentation/>)

- You have to adapt your Windows right access to allow creation of symbolic links for VST 3 plug-ins: [Check HERE!](../Getting+Started/Preparation+on+Windows.md)
- Build the plug-in (you can use Visual Studio too):

``` text
msbuild.exe vstsdk.sln
(or alternatively for example for release)

cmake --build . --config Release
```

---

## Building using cmake-gui

- Start the cmake-gui application which is part of the cmake installation (<https://cmake.org/download/>)

![tutorials_1](../../resources/tutorials_1.png)

- **Browse Source...**: select the folder VST3_SDK
- **Browse Build...**: select a folder where the outputs (projects/...) will be created. Typically a folder named *build*
- You can check the **SMTG Options**
- Press **Configure** and choose the generator in the window that opens: for example "**Visual Studio 16 2019**"

![tutorials_2](../../resources/tutorials_2.png)

- Press **Generate** to create the project
- Open your targeted IDE, and compile the solution/project.
