---

In order to build **VST 3** plug-ins, you need the source code of the **VST 3** (interface definition), an IDE/compiler, cmake and a **VST 3** host application.

## Get the source code

### From the downloaded *vstsdk.zip* file

Download the **VST 3 SDK**: check [VST 3 SDK Download](Links.md).

Unpack the zip file to a development folder on your computer.

### From GitHub:

>git clone --recursive <https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk.git>

## Get an IDE for development

### For Windows

On **Windows**, we recommend that you to use **Visual Studio C++** or **Visual Studio Code**. You can get it for free here <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free>.

### For MacOS

On MacOS, a first choice is **Xcode** (available here <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>).

### For Linux

In order to build the SDK successfully, you need an Ubuntu-based **Linux** distribution. Other distributions might work as well, but are not tested.

1. Download Linux: <http://www.ubuntu.com> or <https://www.linuxmint.com>
2. Install it directly or in a virtual machine like Parallels. We used and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

### Package Requirements

Building the SDK examples requires installation of several packages:

Required:

``` c++
sudo apt-get install cmake gcc "libstdc++6" libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libfontconfig1-dev libcairo2-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libsqlite3-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev
```

>ⓘ **Note**\
>On Raspbian/Debian, replace *"libxcb-util-dev"* with *"libxcb-util0-dev"*

Optional:

``` c++
sudo apt-get install subversion git ninja-build
```

A recommended IDE (optional): **QTCreator**

``` c++
sudo apt-get install qtcreator
```

>ⓘ **Note**\
>You can also use the bash file *"setup_linux_packages_for_vst3sdk.sh"* included in the *VST3_SDK/tools* folder!

>ⓘ **Note**\
>- [Instead of](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/) [**gcc**](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) compiler, a recent version of [**clang**](https://clang.llvm.org/) [compiler will also work!](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/)
>- [libgtkmm3](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/) is required for [**VSTGUI**](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/VSTGUI.md) and the [editorhost](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Index.md#editorhost) example!
>- [Jack Audio](http://www.jackaudio.org) is required for [audiohost](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Index.md#audiohost) example!

## Get cmake

In order to control the compilation process and create an IDE project, **VST 3 SDK** uses the open-source and cross-platform tool [cmake](https://cmake.org/).

You can download cmake here: <https://cmake.org/download/> or use a package manager for your OS (Linux).

You can use it as a command line tool or use the cmake executable with GUI. cmake-gui is included in the cmake package:

>**Specific on Windows**

>---
> You have to adapt your Windows right access to allow creation of symbolic links for **VST 3** plug-ins: [Check HERE!](./Preparation+on+Windows.md)

## Get a VST 3 host application

You can use your favorite **VST 3** host application, see [here](../What+is+VST/Use+cases.md) for some examples, or you can use the [VST 3 Plug-in Test Host](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Plug-in+Test+Host.md) application included in the **VST 3 SDK**.
