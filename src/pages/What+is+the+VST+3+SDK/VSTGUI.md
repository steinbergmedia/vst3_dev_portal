## Introduction

This is a user interface toolkit mainly for audio plug-ins (VST, AudioUnit, etc). Based on the XML definition of the plug-in UI, **VSTGUI** includes an embedded editor (UIDescription Editor) which allows the developer to create a plug-in UI just by drag & drop of the UI element.

First developed in-house by Steinberg Media Technologies (around 1998) for their first VST plug-ins. Later added as binary libraries to the official **VST SDK**. Since May 2003, **VSTGUI** is open source, and is hosted now at GitHub <https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vstgui>.

The last official release version of **VSTGUI** is always included in the **VST 3 SDK**.
