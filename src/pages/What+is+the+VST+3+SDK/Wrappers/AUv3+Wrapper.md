## Introduction

Helper Class wrapping a **VST 3** plug-in to an **Audio Unit v3** plug-in.

The **VST 3 SDK** comes with a helper class which wraps one **VST 3** audio processor and edit controller to an **AU v3** plug-in.

The wrapped AudioUnit does support MPE when the **VST 3** plug-in has Note Expression support. You need to implement [Steinberg::Vst::INoteExpressionPhysicalUIMapping](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/classSteinberg_1_1Vst_1_1INoteExpressionPhysicalUIMapping.html) to map your Note Expression to the limited three expressions defined by MPE.

## How does it work?

- Structure:
  - App (container app which initializes the AU through small Playback Engine)
  - Extension (extension which is loaded by hosts, also initializes the AU)
- How to use the **VST 3** → **AU v3** Wrapper with the sample code:
  - make sure you have correct code signing set up
  - build & run targets
- How to use the **VST 3** → **AU v3** Wrapper with your own VST plug-in:
  - duplicate either the folder again_auv3 or note_expression_synth_auv3 in public.sdk/samples/vst, rename it and edit CMakelist.txt to add your sources, resources and modified target names etc.
  - open audiounitconfig.h and change the definitions in this file.
  - also change the other files in that folder to your requirements. Code signing is required, but you can build and test with a developer only identity.
  - build & run targets
