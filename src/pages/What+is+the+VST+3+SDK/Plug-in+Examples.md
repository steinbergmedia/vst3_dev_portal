## Introduction

The SDK includes some Plug-ins implementation examples. The Legendary **AGain** and **ADelay**, thanks Paul Kellet the Open-source **mda** Plug-ins, a basic "Note Expression Synth" supporting "**Note Expression Event**", an example of **pitchnames** support Plug-in, a **VST 3 Host Checker** which checks if a host is **VST 3** compliant and more...
